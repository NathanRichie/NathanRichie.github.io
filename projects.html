                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Using a Kali VM hosted through HyperV, I created a cron job that automates a backup of files. To do this, I first created two folders, one for 
                    the documents to be backup and the other for the destination folder.   
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/CronProj/desktop.png" alt="Desktop Image">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Second, I created random files with random content.
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/CronProj/files.png" alt="Files Image">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Third, I created a script that creates the backup of the files and directory to then compress it using tar and gzip. I made sure that the generated files would be unique 
                    using the date command. 
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/CronProj/script.png" alt="Script Image">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Fourth, I created the cron job by opening the cron configuration file. It is currently set to backup those folders the 1st of every month.

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Last, I tested my script to make sure the cron job will run. And it worked!

            <h3>&#128187 Installing and Using Active Directory</h3>
                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    I completed the following project for my final capstone project through WGU. 
                </div>

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Active Directory first required I install Windows Server 2019. I downloaded the required ISO file on Microsoft's website and integrated this installation through Hyper-V. The 
                    image below shows proof of installation.
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/AD/hyperv.png">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    While I didn't have an actual network for DHCP to run completely, the picture below shows my configured DHCP server and scope. 
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/AD/dhcp.png">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Next, I created departments and users through Active Directory's Users and Computers tool. Active Directory calls these departments Organizational Units. However, I had to configure a DNS server in order to create a simulated domain for users and departments to be added. This step has no image. 
                    The image below shows this completed section. Each user is not real. If it is a real person, it is a coincidence. 
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/AD/departments.png">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    Finally, I created password security settings for default users through Active Directory's Group Policy Objects. Now when these simulated users login, they will be prompted to change 
                    their password to meet the complexity requirements. The final image below shows the password settings. 
                </div>
                <img class="cron" src="resources/images/AD/passwords.png">

                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    There is a lot more that can be done with Active Directory. As of right now, these are my accomplishments. I will pursue to do more tasks in the future and add onto this.
