                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    <h4>Calhoun Community College</h4>
                    In August 2023-April 2024, I started out going to Calhoun Community College during this year and only took some 
                    foundational courses.

                    <h4>Western Governors University</h4>
                    From October 2024-February 2025, I enrolled and completed my Bachelors of Science, Information Technology degree at WGU. I was able to accelerate 
                    my classes, thus allowing me to finish sooner.

            <h3 id="cert">&#128220 My Certificates:</h3>
                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    <h4>Codecademy Computer Science Path</h4>
                    In August 2023-November 2023, through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a>, I studied Computer Science. 
                    I learned Python, Git, data structures, trees and graphs, algorithms, databases incorporating SQL, 
                    computer architecture, and discrete math. While this isn't on the same level as a computer science degree, this
                    certificate helped me to understand the concepts and use that knowledge within my code.  

                    <h4>CompTIA A+</h4>
                    In December 2023-Febuary 2024, I studied for and completed the CompTIA A+. I utilized 
                    free online course videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser" target="_blank">Professor Messer</a> 
                    and paid for his course notes and practice exams to prepare for these certificates. I learned hardware, Windows OS, Mac OS,
                    Linux, cloud computing, etc. 

                    <h4>CompTIA Security+</h4>
                    In March 2024-May 2024, I completed the CompTIA Security+. Like the A+, I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser" target="_blank">Professor Messer</a>.
                    I learned about laws within tech, firewalls, data protection, cybersecurity practices, etc.

                    <h4>SOC Level 1</h4>
                    In June 2024-July 2024, I decided to enroll in <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank">TryHackMe.com</a>
                    and learn hands on cybersecurity. Within the SOC Level 1, I learned concepts such as Cyber Defense Frameworks, Cyber Threat Intelligence tools, Network Security 
                    and Traffic Analysis like Snort and Wireshark, Endpoint Security Monitoring like Event Logs, SIEM like Splunk, 
                    Digital Forensics tools like Autopsy. 
                    
                    <h4>Jr Penetration Tester</h4>
                    In August 2024-September 2024, I gained valuable insights into ethical hacking practices. Within the Jr Penetration Tester, I learned concepts such as Web Hacking with 
                    Burp Suite, Network Security like NMAP, Vulnerability Research, Metasploit, and Privilege Escalation techniques. I enjoyed this certificate the most out of the two from TryHackMe.

                    <h4>ITIL v4 Foundations</h4>
                    In October 2024, I earned ITIL v4 Foundations certificate. I learned the ITIL terminology and IT Service Management. I utilized Jason Dion's course and practice exams in 
                    preparation for this exam. It was a very basic certifcate that I needed to complete within my WGU degree. 

                    <h4>CompTIA Project+</h4>
                    In November 2024-December 2024, I completed the CompTIA Project+. Here I learned project management, change management, and 
                    issue management. Like the ITIL, I utlilized Jason Dion's practice exams. However, I used CompTIA's official CertMaster Learn for my course material. 
                    
                    <h4>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</h4>
                    End December 2024-January 2025, I passed the exam for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. I learned a lot of foundational knowledge in AWS, specifically their service offerings. 
                    To study for it, I mainly used the official AWS Skillsbuilder for the course material and Jason Dion's practice exams.

                    <h4>CompTIA Network+</h4>
                    In January 2025-early February 2025, I obtained the CompTIA Network+. I learned how IT networks function including: networking devices, ports, routing, IP addressing, 
                    cloud, etc. I watched a mixture of Jason Dion, Andrew Ramdayal, and Professor Messer's videos in preparation. I also took 12 of Jason Dion's practice exams to test my knowledge. 

                    <h4>LPI Linux Essentials</h4>
                    In February 2025, I completed the LPI Linux Essentials certificate. The certificate covered the basics in Linux, Shell Scripting, User and File Permissions, and fundamental 
                    knowledge of open source. I studied using the official LPI learning material found on their website and I practiced on my own installation of Kali Linux on my Hyper-V virtual machine.

                <h4>Hobby Lobby</h4>
                During September 2022-January 2024, I worked as a stockman at Hobby Lobby. I helped stock shelves with products, unloaded trucks and loaded trucks, supported customers with locating 
                items and bringing products to their vehicles, and I cleaned most of the store. I left in order to focus all of my efforts on completing college and my certificates.

                <h4>Hexagon Safety, Infrastructure & Geospatial</h4>
                Since April 2025, I have been working as a Support Engineer I. I help customers with their version of Hexagon's OnCall Dispatch software. I help provide configuration changes, bug escalations, software 
                testing, and after-hours on call. I enjoy making a positive difference in the lives of our public safety agencies and the citizens it helps.

                    <h4>Christian</h4>
                    I believe in the gospel of Christ. I also like to read the bible, attend church, and ultimately help others.  

                    <h4>Outdoors</h4>
                    I enjoy being out in nature especially for fishing, hiking, and camping. I don't get to do this as much as I want unfortunately. But I sure do enjoy it when I do. 

                    <h4>Movies</h4>
                    I'm a big movie guy. Favorite trilogies would be Lord of the Rings and Dark Knight. Favorite single movies would be Interstellar and Gladiator.

                    <h4>Gym</h4>
                    Life has been much better since going to the gym. Not only helps me physically but most importantly mentally. Not a fan of cardio but lifting weights is what I enjoy most there.
